# basicalgorithmjava

Based on this project:
https://github.com/StephenGrider/AlgoCasts

I have created my version for algorithm exercise in Java.

Either use the exercise project that contains the skeleton for the the algorithm 
and the unit test if you want to create your own version.
OR 
Check the solution project which contains the implemented classes for each exercise. 

To test them run
mvn test

in the correct project. This command will execute the TestNG based unit tests.
